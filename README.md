# Description

This repository contains the source code to generate do-support data from 
the [Penn Parsed Corpora of Middle English](https://www.ling.upenn.edu/hist-corpora/)
and the [York-Helsinki Parsed Corpus of Early English Correspondence](http://www-users.york.ac.uk/~lang22/PCEEC-manual/index.htm).

The queries and the code were constructed by [Hezekiah Akiva Bacovcin](http://www.hakivabacovcin.com/) and 
[Christopher Ahern](http://christopherahern.github.io/).  


# Instructions

## Data

Starting in the 15th century we see a change in how tense is expressed in English sentences.
In particular, we see an increase in the use of periphrastic *do* as the element that carries
or *supports* the tense information in the sentence.

For example:

> Asked you a question?

becomes: 

> Did you ask a question?

The change towards *do*-support  progresses over several centuries at different rates in different contexts.
The data set generated by this repository covers the period from roughly 1400-1900.
 

## Code

To run the code either download the files as a [ZIP](https://github.com/christopherahern/do-PPCHE/archive/master.zip),
 or clone the repository:

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/christopherahern/do-PPCHE.git

Change directories to the cloned repository. If all of the corpora required (PPCME2, PPCEME, PPCMBE2, PCEEC) are all
in the same directory, then create a symbolic link to that directory:

    ln -s <directory containing all of the corpora> corpus

If the corpora are located in various directory, then create a corpus directory, change to that directory and
create symbolic links to the root directories of each of the individual corpora:

    mkdir corpus
    cd corpus
    ln -s <location of corpus>
    ...

Then pull in [information](https://github.com/bacovcin/parsedenglish_database/tree/9a049bd27df1d89acd6ddba3eb58169d964c1f14)
 about the documents in the corpus:

    git submodule update --init

Once you've structured the repository, run the make script, which outputs the data to `data/do-support.txxt`:

    make all


As a point of reference, `make.sh` takes about 13 minutes to run on a desktop with other applications running:

    time ./make.sh

If you want to remove the intermediate files, run:

    make clean

## Output

In addition to the information compiled in [this repository](https://github.com/bacovcin/parsedenglish_database/blob/9a049bd27df1d89acd6ddba3eb58169d964c1f14/English_database.txt).
The data will be output to `data/do-support.txt` with the following additional columns:
do.supp	clause	negation
* do.supp : whether or not the token exhibits do-support
* clause : the kind of clause (declarative, question, imperative)
* negation : whether the sentence contains sentential negation or not

Note that these are all defined by the queries in `coding.c`.

It takes a lot of time and effort to build and annotate historical corpora well, so it's important to acknowledge that hard work.
